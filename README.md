# OutlookGoogleCalendarSync

A simple utility to keep your Outlook Calendar in sync with a Google calendar. It can be configured to run in the systray and sync periodically.

The original source came from a codeplex project by Zissis Siantidis many years ago and I have modified and extended it to suit my needs.
